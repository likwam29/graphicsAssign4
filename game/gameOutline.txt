This game will be like a 1v1 game of pacman where both the villian and hero are trying to collect
the most volkswagens before the timer runs out. The game will start out with a hero, villian and a 
set number of volkswagens in the arena. Then once the number of cars gets below a threshhold number
there will be a new set of cars randomly generated on the board. Once the time runs out a winner will
be declared.
